One of the most useful tools I've developed is a template for treating individuals with joint hypermobility. Ehlers-Danlos patients often appear fine regardless of their suffering, as there is typically no visible indication of a problem. Men, in general, tend to be visual, which can lead to a misimpression when they are examining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The neck is usually an early and progressive problem, prompting individuals to seek medical care. However, X-rays and MRIs often appear normal. Arthritis in the neck is termed spondylosis, and nerve root impingement is called radiculopathy. Anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis occur when there is excess movement in the frontal plane between the vertebrae, while myelopathy signifies spinal cord compression. When caring for Ehlers-Danlos patients with vague arm complaints, evaluation must begin at the neck. Pressure on nerve roots as they exit the neck causes referred pain where the nerve ends, not at the site of impingement. The neck itself may or may not be sore.

Moving down the arm, the next area of concern is the thoracic outlet. This is where the artery from the heart, veins from the arm, and nerves from the neck pass into the arm. This area is inherently tight, more so in women, who typically have narrower shoulders. Consequently, these problems often cause more pain in women than in men, based on my observation. Pressure or tension on the nerves in the thoracic outlet causes vague arm pain where the nerves terminate, not at the point of compression. Therefore, when evaluating a patient with inherently vague, intermittent complaints, it is important to examine for thoracic outlet issues.

The shoulder often tends to be unstable and can sublux inferiorly, meaning it partially dislocates. The nerves travel with the arm, and tension can be placed on them as they exit the neck and enter the arm. This can cause the nerves themselves to become sore, leading to burning pain where the nerve ends, not where it is being pulled. Breast weight can complicate the situation, particularly in women, tending to pull the chest forward and down.

Continuing around the arm, tennis elbow and forearm pain on the outside of the arm are very common in patients with joint hypermobility issues. I will explain my theory regarding this. Proximal nerve entrapment can cause carpal tunnel-like symptoms, which is distinct from carpal tunnel syndrome. It involves the same nerve, but compression at the elbow results in more vague pain. This pain tends to manifest more in the carpal tunnel area where the nerve ends. The resulting weakness is specific and peculiar, as there are several ways to adapt to it, and the weakness itself is painless. However, these adaptations can cause problems in other joints in hypermobile patients. Many of these complaints are misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or atypical carpal tunnel syndrome, sometimes leading to ineffective surgery. This explains why actual carpal tunnel syndrome is likely one of the least common problems for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patients, yet it is one of the most frequent diagnoses they receive.

The same physiological mechanisms that can lead to carpal tunnel-like symptoms can also cause pain along the flexor tendons in the palm. This pain is typically activity-related and improves with rest. The thumb is often unstable in patients with connective tissue disorders and can become painful long before arthritis develops. Untreated instability can lead to arthritis, affecting one-third to one-half of women by age 55. This is a very common problem that is significantly underestimated and underappreciated by the medical profession, particularly by male practitioners, as it is a relatively rare issue in men.

The wrist is frequently unstable in patients with hypermobility issues, and a fall can easily exacerbate this instability and cause pain. Arthritis in the wrist tends not to occur unless there is an actual ligament tear; however, since the ligaments are inherently stretchy, they are more prone to overstretching than tearing. The weakness caused by proximal nerve entrapment is extremely frustrating. It makes it difficult to perform tasks such as opening items in the kitchen, turning keys, pulling zippers, buttoning small buttons, and folding laundry. Pinch strength is impaired, which, while not directly harmful, causes significant frustration. This frustration can eventually affect posture.

These problems are all exacerbated if individuals are overweight. The problems also worsen with age, as blood supply to the nerves diminishes and, I believe, the tissues surrounding the nerves become tighter. Patients under sustained stress—be it physical, emotional, or financial—may become tired or depressed. When these feelings manifest physically, they often affect posture, causing the shoulders to drop forward and down, thereby pulling on the nerves.

With this pattern of problems, individuals experience vague, intermittent symptoms that appear to come and go randomly. It can be highly inconvenient if multiple symptoms flare up simultaneously. The pain can be distracting enough to make it difficult to concentrate or perform tasks related to employment or childcare. Thoracic outlet surgery is inherently risky and, generally speaking, should be avoided. The main surgical techniques include rib resection or removal of the interscalene muscles. Rib resection is arguably a better operation but is hazardous; it can cause death as well as complications like hemothorax or pneumothorax, and also poses a risk of nerve injury. Scalenectomy can destabilize the head, and cutting stabilizing muscles in loose-jointed individuals is generally not advisable. It may be necessary in some cases, but it should be considered a last resort.

Another contributing factor is our modern posture: we have transitioned from being upright to frequently leaning forward and twisting our arms. The nerves running from the neck to the hand are not designed for prolonged maintenance of this position. There is also DNA evidence suggesting that the human form originated from marine life. For instance, sea lions possess a hand, wrist, and forearm, complete with a radius, ulna, humerus, and scapula. In such animals, the shoulder joint is designed for loading, partial weight-bearing, and inward pushing. As humans became upright, the shoulder evolved into a traction joint. Our tendency to lean forward and twist our arms contributes to these patterned problems and pain.

The shoulder in Ehlers-Danlos patients is invariably loose. Specific exercises can help stabilize the shoulder. However, my current hypothesis is that patients with loose joints also have 'soft' nerves, and these nerves can be compromised as they pass through anatomical tunnels, which may also be affected by the loose joints. One such nerve is likely the suprascapular nerve, which innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. If this theory is correct, it would explain why some patients undergo physical therapy for years yet fail to stabilize their shoulders: the nerve supplying the shoulder stabilizers may not be functioning correctly.

Surgical capsular stabilization is a reliable operation. However, in my experience, it is difficult to find an orthopedic surgeon willing to operate on multidirectional instability in a patient with a collagen disorder. The reasons for this reluctance are unclear, but finding a provider willing to accept the risks of a stiff joint or surgical failure is a significant challenge. Tissue augmentation devices, which were not available until relatively recently, are now accessible and likely to make this operation more predictable in patients with poor connective tissues.

Moving further down the arm, elbow pain is a fairly common problem in Ehlers-Danlos patients. During a talk I gave in Baltimore to an audience of approximately 500 people, nearly everyone raised their hand when asked if they experienced pain in this general area. The extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle can hypertrophy, sometimes becoming so enlarged that it detaches. My theory is that radial tunnel and lateral epicondyle pain are indirectly caused by compression of the median nerve at the elbow. The median nerve crosses the elbow and pierces the pronator teres muscle. This compression compromises a small branch called the anterior interosseous nerve, which supplies the thumb and index finger flexors. This weakness can be compensated for by wrist extension, performed by the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis muscles, which pull the wrist upward. The extensor carpi radialis longus attaches directly to bone, but the brevis attaches to a layer of fascia. This fascia can rip; when it rips, it swells, and this swelling causes pain. Unfortunately, this pain occurs directly over the radial nerve, which becomes the posterior interosseous nerve. Pain in this area, when treated by an orthopedic surgeon, is generally addressed as a nerve problem, whereas it is often primarily a tendon problem. Because it is treated as a nerve problem, nerve tests are often ordered. If the nerve test is normal, it is often concluded that the nerve is not the issue. However, tendon problems do not show up on nerve tests. It can be a combination of a tendon and a nerve problem, yet not be detectable by such tests.

If the ligament pressing on the median nerve is cut, that segment of the nerve can function normally immediately, and patients no longer need to adapt. If the deep fascia of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is cut, the pain ceases. Approximately 95% of patients experience about 95% pain relief if both the fascia is cut and the nerve is decompressed. If only the nerve is decompressed, as described in most literature on this topic, the success rate in fairly large series is between 50 and 60%. This lower success rate is not encouraging if such a surgical procedure is proposed.

The radial tunnel can be exposed through a lateral forearm incision, an approach I formerly used. Alternatively, one can incise directly through the extensors. I had a hypermobile patient who had undergone an unsuccessful operation by a well-known surgeon in Seattle. She came to me unemployed, on narcotics, and had been told she was a 'bad healer.' In hypermobile patients, a lateral forearm incision invariably results in a disfiguring scar. Her initial surgery, following textbook descriptions, involved decompressing the nerve but not addressing the extensor carpi radialis brevis fascia. I revised her surgery, ensuring the fascia was also addressed. This resulted in pain relief, cessation of narcotics, a return to work, and subsequent referrals of her friends and relatives. Another patient had undergone nerve decompression, which was unsuccessful. The patient experienced the same symptoms in the recovery room as before the surgery. I revised his surgery using an anterior incision. His hypermobility is evident from the width of the scar.

The median nerve crosses the elbow and gives off the anterior interosseous branch, which innervates three muscles and provides a large sensory branch to the wrist bones. Pinching this nerve at the elbow causes weakness, particularly when opening items in the kitchen, such as peel packs and potato chip bags. If the condition worsens, it causes aching pain in the carpal tunnel because that is where the nerve ends. This is often mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome because the pain is experienced in the carpal tunnel, not at the site where the nerve is pinched.

A drawing from the Mayo Clinic illustrates the terminal branch of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is quite large. This branch is located in the carpal tunnel, and pinching the nerve at the elbow causes aching pain in the carpal tunnel that can be severe at times. One of the hazards for hypermobile individuals is undergoing carpal tunnel surgery for intermittent severe wrist pain in the carpal tunnel when the actual problem is at the elbow.

Endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery performed by me has an almost 100% success rate and results in a very small scar. Addressing the proximal nerve entrapment is likely a safer operation with a quicker recovery. Cutting the problematic fascia restores strength to those three muscles and eliminates the referred pain, often in the recovery room.
