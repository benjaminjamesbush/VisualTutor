One of the most useful tools I've developed is a template for treating individuals with joint hypermobility. Ehlers-Danlos patients often appear fine regardless of their suffering, as there is typically no visible indication of a problem. Men, in general, tend to be visual, which can lead to a misimpression when they are examining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The neck is usually an early and progressive problem, prompting individuals to seek medical care. However, X-rays and MRIs often appear normal. Arthritis in the neck is termed spondylosis, and nerve root impingement is called radiculopathy. Anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis occur when there is excess movement in the frontal plane between the vertebrae, while myelopathy signifies spinal cord compression. When caring for Ehlers-Danlos patients with vague arm complaints, evaluation must begin at the neck. Pressure on nerve roots as they exit the neck causes referred pain where the nerve ends, not at the site of impingement. The neck itself may or may not be sore.

Moving down the arm, the next area of concern is the thoracic outlet. This is where the artery from the heart, veins from the arm, and nerves from the neck pass into the arm. This area is inherently tight, more so in women, who typically have narrower shoulders. Consequently, these problems often cause more pain in women than in men, based on my observation. Pressure or tension on the nerves in the thoracic outlet causes vague arm pain where the nerves terminate, not at the point of compression. Therefore, when evaluating a patient with inherently vague, intermittent complaints, it is important to examine for thoracic outlet issues.

The shoulder often tends to be unstable and can sublux inferiorly, meaning it partially dislocates. The nerves travel with the arm, and tension can be placed on them as they exit the neck and enter the arm. This can cause the nerves themselves to become sore, leading to burning pain where the nerve ends, not where it is being pulled. Breast weight can complicate the situation, particularly in women, tending to pull the chest forward and down.

Continuing around the arm, tennis elbow and forearm pain on the outside of the arm are very common in patients with joint hypermobility issues. I will explain my theory regarding this. Proximal nerve entrapment can cause carpal tunnel-like symptoms, which is distinct from carpal tunnel syndrome. It involves the same nerve, but compression at the elbow results in more vague pain. This pain tends to manifest more in the carpal tunnel area where the nerve ends. The resulting weakness is specific and peculiar, as there are several ways to adapt to it, and the weakness itself is painless. However, these adaptations can cause problems in other joints in hypermobile patients. Many of these complaints are misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or atypical carpal tunnel syndrome, sometimes leading to ineffective surgery. This explains why actual carpal tunnel syndrome is likely one of the least common problems for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patients, yet it is one of the most frequent diagnoses they receive.

The same physiological mechanisms that can lead to carpal tunnel-like symptoms can also cause pain along the flexor tendons in the palm. This pain is typically activity-related and improves with rest. The thumb is often unstable in patients with connective tissue disorders and can become painful long before arthritis develops. Untreated instability can lead to arthritis, affecting one-third to one-half of women by age 55. This is a very common problem that is significantly underestimated and underappreciated by the medical profession, particularly by male practitioners, as it is a relatively rare issue in men.

The wrist is frequently unstable in patients with hypermobility issues, and a fall can easily exacerbate this instability and cause pain. Arthritis in the wrist tends not to occur unless there is an actual ligament tear; however, since the ligaments are inherently stretchy, they are more prone to overstretching than tearing. The weakness caused by proximal nerve entrapment is extremely frustrating. It makes it difficult to perform tasks such as opening items in the kitchen, turning keys, pulling zippers, buttoning small buttons, and folding laundry. Pinch strength is impaired, which, while not directly harmful, causes significant frustration. This frustration can eventually affect posture.

These problems are all exacerbated if individuals are overweight. The problems also worsen with age, as blood supply to the nerves diminishes and, I believe, the tissues surrounding the nerves become tighter. Patients under sustained stress—be it physical, emotional, or financial—may become tired or depressed. When these feelings manifest physically, they often affect posture, causing the shoulders to drop forward and down, thereby pulling on the nerves.

With this pattern of problems, individuals experience vague, intermittent symptoms that appear to come and go randomly. It can be highly inconvenient if multiple symptoms flare up simultaneously. The pain can be distracting enough to make it difficult to concentrate or perform tasks related to employment or childcare. Thoracic outlet surgery is inherently risky and, generally speaking, should be avoided. The main surgical techniques include rib resection or removal of the interscalene muscles. Rib resection is arguably a better operation but is hazardous; it can cause death as well as complications like hemothorax or pneumothorax, and also poses a risk of nerve injury. Scalenectomy can destabilize the head, and cutting stabilizing muscles in loose-jointed individuals is generally not advisable. It may be necessary in some cases, but it should be considered a last resort.

Another contributing factor is our modern posture: we have transitioned from being upright to frequently leaning forward and twisting our arms. The nerves running from the neck to the hand are not designed for prolonged maintenance of this position. There is also DNA evidence suggesting that the human form originated from marine life. For instance, sea lions possess a hand, wrist, and forearm, complete with a radius, ulna, humerus, and scapula. In such animals, the shoulder joint is designed for loading, partial weight-bearing, and inward pushing. As humans became upright, the shoulder evolved into a traction joint. Our tendency to lean forward and twist our arms contributes to these patterned problems and pain.

The shoulder in Ehlers-Danlos patients is invariably loose. Specific exercises can help stabilize the shoulder. However, my current hypothesis is that patients with loose joints also have 'soft' nerves, and these nerves can be compromised as they pass through anatomical tunnels, which may also be affected by the loose joints. One such nerve is likely the suprascapular nerve, which innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. If this theory is correct, it would explain why some patients undergo physical therapy for years yet fail to stabilize their shoulders: the nerve supplying the shoulder stabilizers may not be functioning correctly.

Surgical capsular stabilization is a reliable operation. However, in my experience, it is difficult to find an orthopedic surgeon willing to operate on multidirectional instability in a patient with a collagen disorder. The reasons for this reluctance are unclear, but finding a provider willing to accept the risks of a stiff joint or surgical failure is a significant challenge. Tissue augmentation devices, which were not available until relatively recently, are now accessible and likely to make this operation more predictable in patients with poor connective tissues.

Moving further down the arm, elbow pain is a fairly common problem in Ehlers-Danlos patients. During a talk I gave in Baltimore to an audience of approximately 500 people, nearly everyone raised their hand when asked if they experienced pain in this general area. The extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle can hypertrophy, sometimes becoming so enlarged that it detaches. My theory is that radial tunnel and lateral epicondyle pain are indirectly caused by compression of the median nerve at the elbow. The median nerve crosses the elbow and pierces the pronator teres muscle. This compression compromises a small branch called the anterior interosseous nerve, which supplies the thumb and index finger flexors. This weakness can be compensated for by wrist extension, performed by the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis muscles, which pull the wrist upward. The extensor carpi radialis longus attaches directly to bone, but the brevis attaches to a layer of fascia. This fascia can rip; when it rips, it swells, and this swelling causes pain. Unfortunately, this pain occurs directly over the radial nerve, which becomes the posterior interosseous nerve. Pain in this area, when treated by an orthopedic surgeon, is generally addressed as a nerve problem, whereas it is often primarily a tendon problem. Because it is treated as a nerve problem, nerve tests are often ordered. If the nerve test is normal, it is often concluded that the nerve is not the issue. However, tendon problems do not show up on nerve tests. It can be a combination of a tendon and a nerve problem, yet not be detectable by such tests.

If the ligament pressing on the median nerve is cut, that segment of the nerve can function normally immediately, and patients no longer need to adapt. If the deep fascia of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is cut, the pain ceases. Approximately 95% of patients experience about 95% pain relief if both the fascia is cut and the nerve is decompressed. If only the nerve is decompressed, as described in most literature on this topic, the success rate in fairly large series is between 50 and 60%. This lower success rate is not encouraging if such a surgical procedure is proposed.

The radial tunnel can be exposed through a lateral forearm incision, an approach I formerly used. Alternatively, one can incise directly through the extensors. I had a hypermobile patient who had undergone an unsuccessful operation by a well-known surgeon in Seattle. She came to me unemployed, on narcotics, and had been told she was a 'bad healer.' In hypermobile patients, a lateral forearm incision invariably results in a disfiguring scar. Her initial surgery, following textbook descriptions, involved decompressing the nerve but not addressing the extensor carpi radialis brevis fascia. I revised her surgery, ensuring the fascia was also addressed. This resulted in pain relief, cessation of narcotics, a return to work, and subsequent referrals of her friends and relatives. Another patient had undergone nerve decompression, which was unsuccessful. The patient experienced the same symptoms in the recovery room as before the surgery. I revised his surgery using an anterior incision. His hypermobility is evident from the width of the scar.

The median nerve crosses the elbow and gives off the anterior interosseous branch, which innervates three muscles and provides a large sensory branch to the wrist bones. Pinching this nerve at the elbow causes weakness, particularly when opening items in the kitchen, such as peel packs and potato chip bags. If the condition worsens, it causes aching pain in the carpal tunnel because that is where the nerve ends. This is often mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome because the pain is experienced in the carpal tunnel, not at the site where the nerve is pinched.

A drawing from the Mayo Clinic illustrates the terminal branch of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is quite large. This branch is located in the carpal tunnel, and pinching the nerve at the elbow causes aching pain in the carpal tunnel that can be severe at times. One of the hazards for hypermobile individuals is undergoing carpal tunnel surgery for intermittent severe wrist pain in the carpal tunnel when the actual problem is at the elbow.

Endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery performed by me has an almost 100% success rate and results in a very small scar. Addressing the proximal nerve entrapment is likely a safer operation with a quicker recovery. Cutting the problematic fascia restores strength to those three muscles and eliminates the referred pain, often in the recovery room.

The following describes patients with weakness of the muscles innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve, who had completely normal electrical tests. A video demonstrates this weakness. Preoperatively, the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger (FDP IF) were weak. Electromyography (EMG) results for FPL and pronator quadratus (PQ) were all normal. During a pre-operative examination, when asked to pull with the index finger, the patient showed no strength. Similarly, the middle finger strength was such that the examiner could not budge it. The previous assessment was outside the operating room. Half an hour later, in the recovery room, Patient #741 showed immediate postoperative improvement. When asked to pull down with the index finger, the patient's response indicated a significant difference and good strength. Thumb strength also returned when tested.

The thumb strength returns as well. The first patient presented with intermittent wrist pain. The next patient, #742, experienced pain in the radial tunnel. Preoperatively, this patient's index finger was completely weak when asked to pull down. The middle finger strength was also significantly compromised, and the thumb showed no strength at all. Immediately postoperatively, Patient #742 demonstrated good strength in the index finger, with the examiner noting they were pulling as hard as possible. The thumb strength also returned.

Patient #860 presented with weakness in the left thumb. When asked to pull the thumb straight down preoperatively, the patient demonstrated significant weakness and an adaptive movement, which the examiner had to block to assess true strength. In the recovery room, this patient's strength was so improved that the examiner noted being able to metaphorically "lift him off the table" with the resistance. Postoperatively, when Patient #860 was asked to make a tight fist and pull down, the strength was good.

People adapt to this weakness. One adaptation is biting pill containers because prescription pill bottles are extremely difficult to open. Consequently, individuals may leave them open or obtain non-childproof containers. The weakness is profound in hypermobile patients; this problem affects virtually 100 percent of patients with hypermobility issues.

The compression of the nerve does not necessarily damage it. It is likely a combination of low pressure over a large surface area and deflection of the nerve. As soon as the fascial band is cut, the nerve is perfused normally and conducts normally. The technique involves cutting the biceptal aponeurosis, the structure attached to the biceps, which pushes the pronator teres muscle into the median nerve. It also involves cutting the fascia of the ulnar origin of the pronator. Neither of these structures is essential, and no prolonged healing is required; the nerve functions normally as soon as this is done.

In an intraoperative view, at the top of the image is the artery, followed by the vena comitantes, and then the median nerve. The white triangular structure in the middle is the fascia of the ulnar origin of the pronator teres muscle, wrapping around the median nerve (which appears as a shrimp-colored tube to the right). This small band is lifted off the nerve and cut. The ends pop apart, and the anterior interosseous nerve works normally immediately. A large incision is not necessary to expose this; it is typically about one inch.

A patient's right arm, which has undergone the surgery, shows no dent in the forearm from the biceptal aponeurosis, contrasting with a large indentation visible on the unoperated left side. This particular patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had a previous operation by another surgeon that was unsuccessful. The previous doctor might have concluded that surgery is ineffective for Ehlers-Danlos patients due to poor outcomes and scarring. However, redoing the surgery successfully relieved her symptoms. This individual had an anterior interosseous nerve palsy with a problem originating above the elbow but underwent an operation in the forearm. This hypermobile person developed a hypertrophic scar from the unnecessary procedure.

This Ehlers-Danlos patient had surgery on their left side a couple of months prior, followed by the right side. In such patients, scars tend to be slightly wider. They also underwent wrist surgery for painful wrist instability. People who have this weakness may exhibit a characteristic posture when they write. A patient who had their nerve repaired on the right side demonstrated an improved pinch in the recovery room. Before surgery, their pinch, as observed with both hands, was different, indicative of the weakness. When the strength of these muscles is restored by repairing the nerves, the results are immediate and change how people pinch, noticeable even in the recovery room.

There are four ways individuals adapt to this weakness, and the specific adaptation is not a conscious choice. One way is to use the next muscle down, which can lead to arthritis at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the thumb on the radial side, a bone spur, synovitis, or sometimes arthritis at the index finger DIP joint. Individuals who adapt by pinching sideways may either stretch the ulnar collateral ligament at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb or cause increased instability and subsequent subluxation at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the thumb.

Adapting by pinching sideways against the index finger can lead to a painful bone spur at the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint. Patients who compensate by pulling up the wrist may develop tennis elbow, even if they are not tennis players. The looser the joints and the weaker the nerve, and the more distinctly a person adapts via one of these four methods, the higher the likelihood of soft tissue failure. It is observed that looser joints correlate with weaker nerves. This may be because nerves with stretchier collagen are softer and more vulnerable to compression. These are not linear processes. A device is being developed to quantify this, aiming to demonstrate with hard data that the degree of laxity correlates with the degree of weakness, which can explain why these issues manifest differently among individuals.

A flowchart illustrates the following: The primary problem, affecting all patients with hypermobility issues, is median nerve compression at the elbow. This has both sensory and motor consequences. The sensory consequence is pain where the nerve terminates—the carpal tunnel at the wrist—rather than at the site of pinching. This pain is often exacerbated with the palm in a pronated (down) position, particularly during activities like using a mouse or keyboard, driving, or writing.

The motor consequence involves weakness in two muscles: one that bends the distal interphalangeal joint of the thumb and another that bends the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger. This weakness changes how people pinch, an unconscious adaptation. Compensatory actions include pulling the thumb in (using ligaments for resistance) or pulling the wrist up. Referring to the flowchart, items listed (presumably on one side) are painful, do not show on standard tests, and are nearly universal in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other items (presumably on the other side) are visible on X-rays and are more likely to be treated. The former set of issues tends to be ignored, or if tests are ordered and are normal, patients may be reassured that nothing is wrong. Some of these images are available for download on the website ericsonhand.com.

An unstable thumb can be almost dislocated with minimal pressure. On an X-ray, this would appear as the thumb metacarpal not being aligned with the trapezium. If painful, this instability typically progresses to arthritis. According to the Eaton classification of thumb arthritis, the bone initially is located but loose, and then it migrates. As it subluxes, the load on the joint increases, causing premature cartilage wear. This problem affects at least one-third of women, and perhaps 50% by age 55, and is an issue in almost all patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

If a patient is evaluated before cartilage damage occurs at the base of the thumb, the thumb can be stabilized using a tendon to create a new ligament. This procedure is the Eaton-Littler ligament reconstruction, invented in the 1960s and published in 1973. This is a frequently performed procedure in my practice, with approximately 150 cases a year. It is a good operation, even for patients with connective tissue disorders, and has shown very few failures. While native ligaments may not be strong enough in these patients, a tendon can effectively function as a ligament in a non-weight-bearing joint, even in those with connective tissue disorders. The resulting scars from this procedure are typically small. An example is an Ehlers-Danlos patient who also had the pisiform, a small bone in the wrist, removed. This illustrates the appearance of the scars at a later time.

Sometimes the ligament at the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint stretches. Attempting to repair this stretched ligament has a failure rate of approximately 100%. Fusion would be necessary in such cases, and there are multiple techniques for this operation. However, fusions are generally avoided in Ehlers-Danlos patients because they tend to increase the load on the joints adjacent to the fusion site.

If a patient presents with a destroyed joint, ligament reconstruction is not feasible. A salvage procedure involves removing the trapezium, which eliminates the arthritic interface between the thumb metacarpal and the trapezium, and using a tendon to suspend the metacarpal to prevent migration. This procedure works reasonably well. While it does not restore the original function of the thumb, it reliably provides at least 80% pain relief in most patients and restores approximately 80% of pre-arthritic thumb strength. For appropriate candidates, it can be a very effective operation. An X-ray after this procedure shows the trapezium removed, with a titanium bone anchor securing the tendon to the bone to prevent migration. This operation can be performed through a slightly smaller incision.

Patients who adapt by pinching sideways against their index finger can develop a large, painful bone spur at the radial collateral ligament of the index finger metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint. Operating on this bone spur in isolation has an extremely high failure rate, according to orthopedic literature, which generally advises against it. However, if the bone spur is removed, the collateral ligament (which is attached to the spur) is reattached, and the anterior interosseous nerve is concurrently addressed, this operation is successful.

Sometimes the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the thumb hyperextends significantly. This can lead to arthritis on the dorsal aspect of the thumb near the thumbnail, or on the volar aspect where a small sesamoid bone is located within the tendon. If arthritis on the top of the thumb is tender to palpation but not specifically with joint loading and movement, a small incision through a skin crease can be made to remove the bone spur and the swollen synovium, resulting in a quick recovery and immediate pain relief. If pain is on the volar (bottom) side and accompanied by clicking, a small bone called a sesamoid may be involved. This sesamoid, about the size of an Arborio rice grain, does not always appear on X-rays and should be covered with cartilage. It can be a significant nuisance, causing painful clicking at the DIP joint of the thumb, which is almost always mistaken for a tendon problem at the more proximal interphalangeal (IP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Removing this bone leaves a minimal scar.

The pisiform is a sesamoid bone located within a tendon. It can become loose and painful in patients with hypermobility issues. The only definitive treatment for symptomatic pisotriquetral arthritis or pisiform instability is surgical removal of the pisiform. This is an accessory bone that is not essential for hand function. A small incision can be made over it, and the bone is carefully dissected from its tendinous attachments. While straightforward in concept, extreme care must be taken during this operation, especially with a small incision, because the ulnar nerve runs in close proximity to the bone. This approach leaves almost no scar. An Ehlers-Danlos patient who had both pisiforms removed is shown, approximately two months post-surgery on the right and six months post-surgery on the left.

The small finger, index finger, and thumb each have two extensor tendons crossing the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. These tendons can stretch apart from each other and snap back and forth (subluxate). When a tendon displaces sideways, it can cause surprisingly intense pain in the area, despite a normal appearance and no swelling, making it a very subtle diagnosis. There is no non-surgical treatment for this condition. The two tendons can be surgically exposed and sutured back together (centralized), which is a reliable operation. In Ehlers-Danlos patients, addressing all affected tendons for painful snapping has an extremely low recurrence rate when performed this way. This procedure requires careful intraoperative assessment, moving the fingers to ensure the tendons are balanced; it is not a simple matter of just trimming tissue. These tendons are interconnected and interact with each other, so securing one affects adjacent tendons. Therefore, it should not be undertaken lightly, even though it is considered a relatively small operation. In one such patient, before surgery, making a fist caused all the extensor tendons to subluxate into the intermetacarpal grooves. Postoperatively, no cast or formal therapy is typically required. Special techniques are employed during the operation to minimize adhesions.

In the thumb, for extensor tendon instability, the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) can be rerouted or reefed to the adjacent metacarpal or proximal phalanx to improve its line of pull, preventing hyperextension of the MCP joint. The extensor pollicis longus (EPL) is then centralized. An Ehlers-Danlos patient who previously underwent a thumb CMC ligament reconstruction later developed painful subluxation of the EPL tendon, which was addressed with this type of procedure. The resulting scar is shown.

Flexor tenosynovitis is common in patients who frequently perform hand exercises due to underlying weakness. In individuals prone to scar tissue formation, this can cause aching pain along the tendons. These tendons can be exposed through a small incision in a skin crease, the tendon sheath opened, and the inflamed tenosynovium removed, leading to predictable symptom relief.

Instability between the radius and ulna (distal radioulnar joint, or DRUJ, instability) is a less common problem but can be treated surgically. An Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient with wrist instability and DRUJ instability who was treated surgically is presented as an example. The preferred initial surgical method for DRUJ instability is to use the extensor retinaculum that crosses the joint, incising and then reefing it (imbricating it in a 'pants-over-vest' fashion). This is effective most of the time. If this reconstruction stretches out and recurrent instability occurs, a more invasive operation can be performed. This involves harvesting a tendon graft, drilling holes through the radius and ulna, and passing the tendon through these holes to re-establish the ligamentous constraints of the DRUJ. This is a reliable operation, even in Ehlers-Danlos patients.

One of the first Ehlers-Danlos patients treated by the speaker underwent multiple surgeries starting in the early 1990s. These included procedures for bilateral thumb instability, bilateral wrist instability, bilateral pisiform excision, bilateral median nerve decompression in the forearm, and radial tunnel release. The patient responded well to each operation. Subsequently, after a fall, she developed painful instability at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joints of her ring and small fingers. At that time, these were fused. She did well until the fusion mass fractured due to trauma, necessitating a further fusion to the adjacent bone, with which she also did well. Current practice might involve prolotherapy for such CMC instability. In contrast to patients in earlier years who often presented with one primary issue at a time, contemporary patients frequently present with multiple concurrent problems. This particular patient eventually underwent most of the operations described in this presentation.

Returning to a broader approach, the recommended treatment involves a holistic view of the patient, considering their life stage and daily stressors. Rather than simply advising stress reduction, the goal is to offer strategies for coping with existing stress, as individuals may face difficult choices where they must select the less painful or stressful option. The aim is to assist them in this process.

Surgery for these conditions is reliably successful if patients have good posture and stable shoulders. It is less reliable in improving functional status if patients have poor posture and loose shoulders. Sometimes, problems below the elbow are so painful that patients cannot perform the necessary exercises to correct their posture. In such cases, surgery may be performed despite poor posture and unstable shoulders, but an attempt is made to address any thoracic outlet component first. For patients with significant thoracic outlet issues, the primary goal is to make their condition as manageable as possible, which typically means achieving the strongest and most pain-free hand function from the elbow down. Therefore, any correctable painful condition from the elbow down would be addressed to give the patient the best chance of maintaining good posture.

The majority of patients who continue to have significant functional limitations related to employment, keyboard use, or arm work often have an underlying thoracic outlet syndrome, which should be identified early. Anxiety is a core finding in patients with joint laxity and hypermobility. When these individuals seek medical care, they may develop what can be described as a form of post-traumatic stress response related to negative healthcare experiences. They may become reluctant to see doctors, anticipating a negative outcome: long waits, difficulty explaining vague or intermittent complaints, feeling challenged or disrespected, followed by normal test results (e.g., MRI), and a dismissal of their concerns. This cycle can reinforce their fears and lead to feelings of frustration, perceiving the consultation as a waste of time and money, and feeling that the doctor considers their issues to be psychological, when in fact, the medical system's response may be contributing to their distress.

So this is the patient population tends to wind up in my office and this explains the majority of symptoms that can be addressed. And patients generally speaking do well when they are motivated and they have adequate support.

The indications for surgery in general would be when things are too painful to go on with whatever's been done so far. It is helpful if the diagnosis is clear and that is rarely the case in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients. They usually have more than one problem and they often overlap in terms of where the symptoms are expressed.

Not every doctor knows about these options. There are I think about a thousand hand surgeons in the US with my level of training and they did not all get the same education that I got. So I don't know anyone else doing capsular stabilizations of the wrist for the wrist instability that Ehlers-Danlos patients have. And I don't know anyone doing as many thumb ligament reconstructions as I do. And some people, some hand surgeons are just not aware that these are options.

The other problem is that surgery is just an inherently risky thing to do and you may not know where you are on this thing called Scott's parabola. But surgical techniques come and go and some new idea comes out and then a bunch of people do it and the results are good and then with careful follow-up the results turn out not to be so good. And then it turns out maybe it's not a good idea to do it at all. For example, tuberculosis wasn't really understood in terms of being an infectious disease and there was a period of time where if you had tuberculosis in your lungs, they would remove your lung, which got rid of the tuberculosis but also got rid of your lung. And these days no one would remove a lung for tuberculosis, they would give you antibiotics. But every surgical procedure is at risk for being on this curve somewhere. So if someone comes out with some new idea, I would generally wait and see if it really is a good idea because the history of surgery is full of operations that people thought were great and then turned out not to be so great.

Sometimes the goals are very clear and realistic and that happens when you have a good doctor who's able to communicate and a patient who's able to understand. And if you are not communicating well with your doctor, it's probably not a good idea to have surgery. The risks of surgery are clearly higher in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The wounds in my experience do not have any problems healing. The scars tend to be a little bit wider. But I did show you some examples of huge scars with surgeries that didn't work. And the problems, the causes of that are multiple in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and they're not the patient's fault.

If you have one of these problems that's straightforward, that part can be fixed, but the doctor and the patient may be under the impression that that was the only problem and it is very easy to undergo surgery and just have marginal improvement and it frustrates everyone.

The other issues with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is they tend to get dizzy when they stand up quickly and the ankles are unstable so people fall routinely. And it's very easy to make the thumb and the wrist that were already loose, make them loose and painful. And the normal things that people take for this like aspirin tend not to be an option for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome because they almost all have gastroesophageal reflux. There are also hormones that circulate that make the joints looser at different times of the month and things swell differently at different times of the month. Just makes it very complicated if you're the patient. And even simple things like having a trigger finger release, patients with collagen disorders are often resistant to Xylocaine and Bupivacaine. So they go to the dentist and the local anesthesia doesn't work. That's a clue that they might have a connective tissue disorder. And worrying about all these things and facing them when they are invisible to everyone else gets people to be pretty tired and after a couple of months people get grouchy, it's hard on couples.

Surgical procedures that are fairly routine that should be approached with caution, particularly in Ehlers-Danlos patients. Carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome is common, but that's usually not the problem in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It's usually the median nerve at the elbow and they tend to manage the symptoms by changing how they do their activities and that works reasonably well until they get carpal tunnel syndrome on top of it. Then the carpal tunnel gets recognized and operated on, but the problem that has been there the whole time intermittently is still there and then patients and doctors are disappointed. The thumb collateral ligament repair tends to fail unless you fix the nerve at the same time. And the forces are high enough that the ligament reconstructions are not reliable and fusion is probably better. The index finger collateral ligament bone spur I talked about where the failure rate in the orthopedic literature is extremely high. Stabilization procedures for hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal joints are just fraught with hazard. The tissues stretch and recurrent instability is a problem. The wrist capsular stabilization works well in this patient population. I've had very few recurrences. But patients do get tendons operated on like De Quervain's tenosynovitis. The nerve problem at the elbow, the median nerve causes pain at the wrist and this gets mistaken for De Quervain's and people have surgery that can easily make them worse. 

Taking bones out can cause more instability in patients with connective tissue disorders that cause other problems. The radial tunnel surgery is predictable if you know the person's posture is good and they don't have thoracic outlet symptoms, but that is not how most of my colleagues look at this. They look at it as a nerve problem when it's actually mostly a tendinosis. Ulnar nerve surgery, inherently hazardous in Ehlers-Danlos patients. Most of the patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have ulnar nerve symptoms, but they tend to be from the thoracic outlet. And operating on the ulnar nerve at the elbow can easily make the nerve problem worse.


We talked about the shoulder stabilization is just inherently difficult for the doctor and the patient. And thoracic outlet surgery can cause many more problems. So it's just not something to take lightly.

So, it has been my pleasure to take care of patients with these problems and I feel fortunate to have figured out a few of these issues. And you're not alone if you're hypermobile. These problems affect a huge number of people, particularly women. There are treatments. This is a video of a patient of mine, typical hypermobile patient.

So, ... patient today with joint hypermobility issues and she has wrist pain and thumb pain. And the thumb pain is at the base of the thumb. This is an exam for basal joint instability. You can see the bone move almost a centimeter and it also moves outwards a centimeter. And this is loose and painful.

The other thing that she has is wrist instability and she has full motion wrist, and this is the scaphoid. And if I move her wrist into radial deviation and push under her scaphoid, you can see the wrist dislocate. And that is painful. Full motion but mechanical instability. And this would have normal X-ray, normal MRI, normal bone scan, normal arthrogram, normal arthroscopy, but abnormal motion under load. Let's switch to the other side.

So, she has had surgery to correct these problems on her right side. And you can see there's not much of a scar. Part of the tendon is taken here and passed underneath the skin until this point and then passed underneath these muscles. And with the same exam, the thumb doesn't really move this way. And in this plane, it moves just a little bit, which is normal. But quite snug. And when the joint is reduced and loaded, the joint motion is smooth and painless. The wrist was stabilized through a small incision here. You can barely see her scar. In spite of the operation, she has basically full motion. But when you push on the scaphoid here, the wrist does not dislocate and it is stable and solid.

Now, she also had hand pain and had a weakness secondary to proximal median nerve entrapment. And that gives you weakness of these two muscles. And if we put her fingers like this, pull as hard as you can. I can't budge this. These two are the same strength. And her thumb, put your thumb down like this. I can't budge.

And if we examine her other side, make a fist for me. You can see a little indentation in her arm, which is where the bicipital aponeurosis pushes the flexor pronator muscles in. If we put her hand, let's get your thumb out of there. Put her hand in this position. These two should have the same strength. On her middle finger, I can't budge. Pull as hard as you can. She has no strength on her index finger. And her thumb... Put your thumb down like this. Pull it hard as you can. No strength at all.

Now, this is a confusing weakness because people can adapt. And you have to understand the adaptability. And since one of the adaptations is to point the wrist up. And with your wrist up, now pull down. This finger is quite strong and the thumb is quite strong. But people who do this all day long, who are loose-jointed, get sore right here. You can say ow. And she had this operated on on this side and resolved the pain and lateral epicondylitis, which was treated at the same time. And she has the same problem on this side where she's exquisitely tender right in this area. This is just so, I mean, sturdy and and reliable and this one just it depends on what I'm doing.

Anyway, that's the conclusion of my presentation. These are common problems. They can be treated. The surgery is predictable if you operate on patients with good posture and stable shoulders. It is less predictable, but can work if you operate on patients who don't have good posture, don't have stable shoulders. Recurrence is low. The this requires a knowledgeable surgeon, a good anesthesiology department and special equipment in the operating room to do these operations through small incisions and an assistant who has good endurance with their arms and can hold very still to do these operations through small incisions. And I'm fortunate to have those circumstances where I am right now, and I'm happy to share this information with anyone who would like to hear about it. So that concludes my talk.

Our first question: is the anchovy surgery appropriate for EDS patients whose thumbs continuously sublux?

Well, the anchovy procedure would be done when there's cartilage damage and it's similar to the operation I do. I actually used to do the anchovy procedure, but the last couple that I did were in hypermobile patients and they totally fell apart. So I stopped doing the anchovy procedure at approximately 2003 or 2004, let's say 2004 I stopped doing the anchovy procedure. You have to look at the whole picture and if the person has arthritis in their neck and they have gastroesophageal reflux and they have bunions and they're falling apart, the tissues around that joint are not likely to be reliable for holding the anchovy in place.

When I moved to Seattle, about the time I moved here, a well-known, well-respected hand surgeon by the name of Roy Meals in LA reported 20-year follow-up on a large number of patients where all he did was take out the trapezium and pin the thumb metacarpal to the index metacarpal in distraction for six weeks and then let it heal. So he called it a hematoma distraction arthroplasty. And his results were as good or better than anyone else's reported results for thumb arthritis surgery. So about 15 years ago, I tried doing his operation, but my patients had problems with the pins. The pins, if you leave them out, would get infected. If you left them under the skin, you had to go back to the operating room and take them out. There are sensory nerves that could get wrapped up by the pin. My patients would do things like elliptical exercise machines and fall off them and bend the pins. So I stopped doing the resection arthroplasty with distraction after I had all kinds of problems with the pins. And I chose this other operation where you take a tendon and split it in half and use part of the tendon to keep it from migrating. And that works reliably. More recently, I've wound up placing the tendon underneath the other half, sort of making a U-turn. And that gives a stiffer joint that's less likely to fall apart.

I recommend mechanically stabilizing the base of the thumb. And I think that can be done with the anchovy procedure. But I also think that if you go to a teaching hospital and the residents are not supervised and they take out the trapezium and just stuff a loose tendon in the space, that that is just not going to work out well for a person who's hypermobile. So it's a complicated way of saying yes, the anchovy procedure is a reasonable option to do and I have seen it work in patients who are hypermobile. It's not my choice, but I've certainly seen it work, but I've also seen it fail through circumstances that the patient wouldn't necessarily be aware of and they're not necessarily good for the patient. So if you know your surgeon and they're smart and well-trained and they do the surgery and they follow their patients, they see the patients pre-op and they see them post-op, not a PA or an MA or a nurse, and they're aware of every failure, those are doctors that you're likely to get better results from. So I would say if you trust your surgeon, you're probably going to be okay.

Alrighty, thank you so much. To continue with surgery questions, what about thumb CMC stabilization with an Arthrex TightRope implant in lieu of ligament reconstruction?

That is a technique that I use to augment my repair when tissues are really crappy. If you use it by itself, it will work for a while, but it's my opinion that that thread, it's a FiberWire suture that goes between the two buttons, that that thread will eventually break. And depending how much scar tissue you've made, it may or may not make any difference because if you hold the bone in place for a while, in some patients, the tissues around the joint will contract and can stabilize the joint. So I have seen patients have a soft tissue capsulorrhaphy where the tissues just got tightened around the joint and then had to supplement it with an Arthrex endobutton technique. And they've done fine, but I've only seen them out like one or two years, so long term I don't know. I have used it, I do use it. It's a great technique to add more stability to the situation. I tend to be a belt and suspender type doctor. So I will add it to a case where I think that the soft tissues are not adequate or if they've had a previous surgery and let's say that patient's particularly pain tolerant, particularly strong-willed and the weak link for them is their soft tissues, that their soft tissues are never going to stand up to their willpower. That's a person where I would tend to use something like that also. As a solitary device, I don't think it's a good idea. But I haven't seen anybody in my geographic area have it used as just a solitary device. But it is a very useful technique. The small incisions, titanium tends not to be a problem unless it's where you can feel it. And someone who's thinking of using supplemental tissues, I think generally speaking is probably a good idea for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Alrighty. And another surgery question.

Do you find there is an increase in the incidence of developing CRPS for patients with EDS following surgery on the hand and wrist?

No. I've had almost no CRPS in any of my patients in the last 15 years. Since I moved to Seattle, it really hasn't been an issue in my patients unless they had CRPS from somebody else's surgery. CRPS is a real thing. Some of my colleagues don't believe it, but if they don't believe it, they've never actually seen the real thing. It's an idiosyncratic thing. It doesn't really have anything to do with the operation itself. It's not like one operation causes it. In my experience, it tends to be in patients who are anxious and who don't have social support and are worried. In that patient population, I try and reassure them, and also use ketamine as a part of their anesthesia. Ketamine helps interrupt chronic pain cycles.

It helps to establish a rapport with the patient where you understand the patient's goals. If the patient doesn't have goals, or if their goals are to be on drugs and be on disability, you don't get in the way of those goals and try and stop them from that. It really hasn't been an issue in my patients at all.

We do a number of things, I do a number of things that are specifically geared towards patients with connective tissue disorders. For example, my assistant is the best assistant I've had in 30 years, and he has extremely strong with his arms, but the strength isn't what matters, it's his endurance. He is able to hold the tissues apart gently as if the patient's awake. We make these little incisions, but he doesn't just crank on the tissues, he just holds still. It's much harder for someone to assist me with these operations with these little incisions, but he could ride a motorcycle all day long and not have his arms be tired.

It helps to have the right diagnosis, and it helps to have just one procedure. You see CRPS in patients who have an injury, like a wrist fracture, and then they have a second injury like a closed reduction where the fracture is manipulated under anesthesia and it falls apart. Then they have another closed reduction and pins. There are some patients, there's a window of vulnerability where if you reinjure them as the body's trying to heal, the normal sensory input gets misdirected to stimulate a pain center in the brain, and it can be a disaster. Going to the operating room once and having one injury, and having the patient have reasonable expectations. Establishing reasonable expectations with the patient and then trying to exceed them makes them much less likely to have anxiety or anxiety-related problems, which I put CRPS in that category. The answer is no. CRPS really has not been an issue in almost any of my patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

All righty, thank you so much. We have a question on tourniquet use with extremity surgery. Should the incision be closed while the tourniquet is still up, or is it best to let it down to check for bleeding before closure?

I personally feel pretty strongly about letting the tourniquet down and waiting till the tissues perfuse, till the arm's warm, and see what bleeds. Particularly with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients where they have capillary fragility, it's pretty easy to just put a retractor in there and if you're just a little bit rough, you can poke a hole or rip a vein. It may not bleed until things are dilated and warmed up.

If I had a student, my recommendation to them would be rigidly to do the surgery with the tourniquet up and not cut any blood vessels at all. Then, when you're done, let the tourniquet down and wait a few minutes. Wash the wounds out, make sure that there's no bleeding. Once you're sure there's no bleeding, then close the skin. Now, doing that, I still have an occasional hematoma. It tends to be a stitch in the subcutaneous tissue that rips a vein, and then it bleeds. It bleeds like a golf ball-sized hematoma. Those tend to resolve spontaneously without any major complications.

I have some colleagues who I know close when the tourniquet's still up. Personally, I don't like phone calls in the middle of the night. I cover all my patients unless I'm out of town. A lot of my colleagues have PAs or MAs assigned out to them and they don't get the call in the middle of the night when things swell up. I don't like surprises. I would not almost ever close an incision with the tourniquet still up. I would want the tourniquet down. In addition to having the tourniquet down, I have the anesthesiologist remove it immediately from the arm because if it's applied properly, it causes a venous tourniquet. If you let the arterial blood flow in and don't let the venous blood flow out, you get a lot of bleeding immediately into the tissue, and that causes swelling and pain. If you take the tourniquet off immediately, you do not get as much bleeding or as much swelling or as much pain. Some of the anesthesiologists don't like it because when they let the tourniquet down, they're supposed to chart that time in their chart, and they're supposed to, they're getting an acid load and they have to be aware of the pulse and the pressure and so forth. They tend not to want to do the tourniquet down and off the arm as part of one step. That's okay, those anesthesiologists don't have to come to my room. We, I want the tourniquet down and off the arm immediately, and I would recommend not closing the incisions with the tourniquet up because you're going to have an occasional bleeder, and you're going to find out late when it's inconvenient, and it's going to be particularly inconvenient to the patient.

Alrighty, thank you so much. We have quite a few questions on finger, thumb, and wrist dislocations, and if there are any braces or splints that you suggest, both for daytime use and to sleep in.

We're not supposed to give specific commercial advice about these things, but I have no conflict of interest. Silver Ring Splints are by far the most effective device for proximal interphalangeal joint issues. They are comfortable and almost pretty.

For the thumb, the ligaments generally need to be repaired surgically. The splints are okay, but they're just never going to be great. If you have Marfan syndrome where everything is extremely loose, those patients actually don't usually come to surgery because they can't really generate enough force to wear out the joint. They are even looser than other Ehlers-Danlos patients, and splints in those cases probably aren't helpful because they're so loose.

Silver Ring Splints, in general, has a whole bunch of products for the thumb and wrist. There's another company, MetaGrip Push Orthotic for the thumb, which is probably the most useful splint for thumb instability issues. It was designed by a hand therapist. It fits the majority of patients' hands if they're a normal range of size and proportions, and they're relatively inexpensive compared to seeing a hand therapist. If you have relief of symptoms with this splint, a short opponens splint, the surgery, the Eaton Littler ligament reconstruction, basically does the same thing as a splint but puts the splint inside. That would be a therapeutic test. If you have someone with vague hand pain and you think it's mostly the thumb, if you put them in a splint for the thumb, a short opponens splint for the thumb, and their pain gets better, then you can be pretty well assured that the ligament reconstruction will do the same thing.

For the wrist, there are U-shaped splints that wrap around the radioulnar joint, and those can be helpful for mild to moderate instability. For wrist instability itself, I don't think the splints are particularly effective in terms of changing the instability, but they can let other people know you're having a problem, and they can reduce the number of times that the joint subluxes, but I don't think they're going to make the wrist stable.

Thumb splints, I'm a big fan of. The finger PIP joint splints, the figure-of-eight splints for the PIP joints, I think are really helpful. I don't think the splints at the end joints are as helpful, but the people with loose joints all the way at the end of their fingers tend to be more in the vascular EDS category rather than just hypermobile and may have other issues that tend to be a bigger problem. I hope that information is helpful.

Yes, thank you so much. Another question: It sounds like neck problems are related to the arm and hand issues. Do you have any suggestions on how to address the combination of issues, especially if the neck becomes worse?

When a patient comes to me, I usually let them talk uninterrupted for several minutes and try to figure out what their highest priority for fixing is, and stratifying their complaints, what is bothering them the most. The patient may start out saying one thing, but you find out when you're actually examining them that they've changed their behavior because of some other problem that's a bigger problem, but they're just working around it, and they're just focused on one problem. That is probably a more realistic approach to try and get medical care, to try and focus on the thing that's bothering you the most when you're seeing a physician.

When you're seeing a physician, if you're not convinced that you're being listened to as a patient, and you're not convinced that your interests are the center of the doctor's attention and focus, you probably should be going someplace else for care. The most successful approach that I advocate is to look at the whole person and try to figure out where they are on their arc of life and what's bothering them the most. In my geographic area, there are neck surgeons, and as a group, they tend to say, "Do you need surgery? If you do, I'm your guy, and if you don't, see ya." That isn't universal, but there is a strong tendency for them to just say, "I'm a technician, not an investigator."

There are physiatrists who are orthopedic doctors who don't do surgery but are trained in physical medicine and rehabilitation. They are typically the most helpful doctors to patients with connective tissue disorders. They are trained typically in neck issues and thoracic outlet issues. Some of them really enjoy seeing Ehlers-Danlos patients because they can almost always help. Some of them just want to do nerve injections or spine injections, some of them just want to do nerve tests. But if you can find someone who actually wants to listen to patients and disambiguate their problems and send them off to specialists for each of the individual problems they have, that can be a great partnership with a patient.

For that patient with their questions, these things overlap, and you have to see someone who understands the overlapping nature of these problems. It wouldn't be unreasonable to start with a physiatrist, which would be an orthopedic doctor. Physiatrists are also called physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors in some areas. Have them look at the spine, start with your posture, and get x-rays of your neck. With hypermobility issues, the x-ray should be done with you upright and also with the neck in flexion and extension. If you're having nerve symptoms that go down the arm, it would probably be advisable to get an MRI of the neck to look at the nerve roots also. Start with posture and neck, and then sort of work things down. The surgery that I do works predictably if the neck and the thoracic outlet are stable and understood. That would be the first step for most of my patients. If they come in with thumb pain, it's not to operate on the thumb, but to look at the whole person and sort of figure out how much of their problem can be changed by a change in their activities as opposed to changing their arm anatomy. Working on posture and weight loss is a delicate topic, but my patient population is not particularly heavy, but nationwide, the country has become obese. Weight loss would be one thing that patients would have under their direct control that would benefit every aspect of their musculoskeletal system if their body mass index was in a reasonable range, but very hard to do with our food chain and processed foods and the expense and inconvenience of eating a healthy diet. Again, I would urge using that template that I've come up with to try and figure out what's bothering the patient the most and incorporate evaluation of the neck and posture as the first steps to that.

Alrighty, thank you so much. We have time for maybe two more questions. Any questions we don't get to, we will forward on to the helpline. If you have any questions that don't get covered today, please reach out to our helpline, email them, call them, they are amazing and they can help you find the answers you need. But for Dr. Erickson, what are your recommendations for sutures and closing to minimize the stretched scars and avoid poor outcome?

The way I do it is I make small incisions, but small incisions means big risk. I could not have done these operations earlier in my career with these little incisions. I couldn't do them without certain equipment, and I couldn't do them without an excellent assistant. It's a team effort.

I try and use all internal stitches and have done so for probably 20 years. I've had a few of these operations myself, and one of the things I really hated more than anything else was suture removal. So unless we're doing little rotation flaps, I will use internal stitches. I used to use Vicryl, which is a common subcutaneous suture that orthopedic doctors use, but my patient population reacts fairly strongly with scar tissue to Vicryl. I switched to Monocryl about 15 years ago, much less tissue reaction.

I have a particular wound closure technique that I use that I've developed that involves one small knot underneath the skin at one end of the incision, and then going through the dermis back and forth in a zigzag fashion, trying to align the edges perfectly. I usually do three layers, and then if it's over a joint, do a fourth layer. Then I will put glue on the skin, something called Mastisol or benzoin, but you have to be careful with Ehlers-Danlos patients because a lot of them have mast cell activation disorder and a lot of contact allergies. You have to make sure they're not allergic to tape or adhesives to do this. You put some glue on the skin and then you put tape on the glue and then cover that with a bandage that makes it so there's very little stress on the incision. If you do that, the incisions heal pretty nicely. They're a little wider than non-Ehlers-Danlos patients, but big stitches and big incisions, especially over big joints, will always give you a big wide scar in a person with loose connective tissue.

In the closure that I recommend, you probably wouldn't let the intern do the closure because if it falls apart, you lose the whole incision, as opposed to interrupted stitches where if you screw up one of the stitches, there are multiple other stitches. These incisions where you just use one stitch, it just has to go in perfectly every time. I feel pretty confident doing that with every single incision. I think I've had one or two incisions open up in the last 10 years, and then it healed fine in spite of that. This is just not for the casual surgeon to do things this way. You really have to have someone who is seriously interested in every single detail about how to get a reasonable scar in addition to fixing the problem. The small incisions are not something that just anyone should try and do. I wouldn't expect other hand surgeons to see this video and then go make a 1 cm incision to decompress the proximal median nerve. That's just not likely to be a good idea.

When I did this operation the first time, I was the assistant and I helped somebody decompress the median nerve from the wrist to the armpit, and it took us an hour or two to close the incision and left a huge ugly scar. That's not necessary. Small incisions, that's one way, but that does increase your risk and you have to really know what you're doing surgically to do these things safely through these little incisions. Monocryl is much less reactive than Vicryl. Nylon stitches put in tight cause pain and don't hold the tissues that well and wind up with big scars. You can tape the scars for a couple weeks afterwards if you don't get an allergic reaction. There's also a steroid impregnated tape called Cordran. If you get a hypertrophic scar, meaning it's raised and pink and it might be itchy or sore, the steroid impregnated tape can make that raised scar soften and flatten within a couple weeks. That's another approach if you have an incisional issue. You can put a steroid on the incision and it will flatten and whiten, especially with these incisions near joints that when you pull on the scar tissue, it tends to contract and you get a bigger, thicker scar around a joint.

Alrighty, our last question for the day comes from somebody that's newly diagnosed. They were just wondering if you could recommend a good place to start in terms of getting a diagnosis with issues, imaging, etc.

I would start with the Ehlers-Danlos website, chronicpainpartners.com. I would go to my webinar. That would be probably the most useful thing I'm aware of for the upper extremity issues, the previous webinar that I did after the talk I gave in Baltimore. I thought was a reasonable place to start for upper extremity. The other webinars on the Chronic Pain Partners.com website are all done by people who are well known in the Ehlers-Danlos community and leaders in their area. If you are having a specific focus of your problem, I would go to the chronicpainpartners.com website and try to find webinar information about that particular issue.

The volume of the American Journal of Medical Genetics that had a special volume on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2017 is also a wonderful place to get information. It tends to be more medical; it would be more helpful if you had a medical degree to read it. If you want to share something with a physician, that supplement to the American Journal of Medical Genetics that was arranged by Brad Tinkle was extremely helpful. If you want to give a doctor something to read, that volume that Brad Tinkle created was fantastic.

Brad Tinkle has also written a couple of books on joint hypermobility issues that I think are extremely helpful. There are additional resources at the chronicpainpartners.com website; there are other books written by patients that divide problems up by organ system. They talk about dysautonomia, GI problems, and musculoskeletal problems by joint.

Those are the most useful things. Brad Tinkle's books on joint hypermobility I thought were extremely well written and helpful in general. The other resources available through the Ehlers-Danlos Society and chronicpainpartners.com, I think have been extremely helpful.
