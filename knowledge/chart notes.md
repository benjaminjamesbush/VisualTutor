**William B Ericson, JR MD**

**Appointment Date:** 05/13/2025

**Rene Bush**
**Date of Birth: 07/24/1983**

**New Patient Visit**

**Reason for Visit**
Posttraumatic left wrist pain and instability

**History of Present IIIness**
The patient is a 42-year-old right-handed female previous daycare worker, currently at home with a high needs child referred by Dr. John Fagan for evaluation of bilateral upper extremity difficulties.

The patient was quite functional until postdelivery 10 years ago when she developed increasing symptoms related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Began in her feet and then progressed to her SI joints. She has shoulder subluxation that required switching from a normal wheelchair to a powered wheelchair.

The patient had an injury to her left wrist while carrying her child in her wheelchair where she developed painful instability of the left DRUJ. The injury occurred approximately March 7, 2025. She eventually sought medical treatment and was felt to have an unstable DRUJ and was placed in a Munster splint/cast about 3 weeks ago. The plan is to remove the embolization in about 3 weeks and reevaluate. MRI shows high-grade tear of the volar DRUJ capsule.

The patient notes bilateral hand weakness as well as numbness, with aching pain radiating proximally. The symptoms have been present for quite a while, and appear to be progressing slowly.

**Review of Systems**
Detailed review of systems in chart. Significant problems include headache, neck pain, TMJ problems, urinary frequency and incontinence, psoriatic arthritis, positive ANA, anxiety, depression, GERD. Family history section for her father dying of a DVT.

**Past Medical History**
H EDS, GERD, anxiety/depression, migraine headaches, cervical polyps.

**Past Surgical History**
Cervical polyps.

**Social History**
Married with needs child.

**Vital Signs**
Height: 64 inches Weight: 145 pounds

**Exam**
The patient is a healthy female who appears her stated age. She is an adequate historian. There is bilateral supraspinatus muscle weakness. Left arm is in a Muenster cast, with the forearm in supination.

The patient's right upper extremity is examined. Sensation hand appears normal. Thenar muscles are strong. First dorsal interosseous is hypertrophy. FPL and FDP index finger strength are quite weak when tested at resting length. The patient is tender in the radial tunnel area but does not have rest pain. Wrist has full range of motion. Scaphoid shift test causes subluxation the carpus with mild pain. Thumb CMC joint is unstable. Testing for instability causes mild pain. When the joint is reduced and loaded joint joint motion is smooth and painless. EPL tendon is subluxed ulnar to metacarpal head. There is global instability of the thumb MP joint, particular in the AP plane. Pisiform is unstable. DRUJ is unstable and testing is today causes mild pain. Positive piano key sign. Test for ulnar impingement and TFCC tear are negative.

**Imaging/Labs**
The patient's MRI of her right wrist shows DISI with 45 degrees dorsal angulation of the lunate, and effusion around the pisiform, and a complete tear of the volar distal radioulnar ligament, with dorsal subluxation of the ulnar head. Radiographs of the patient's left wrist show approximately 40% subluxation of the thumb CMC joint, without arthrosis.

**Diagnosis**
* Typical pattern of upper extremity tendon nerve and joint problems in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
* Patient has a low threshold for thoracic outlet symptoms and is at risk for thoracic outlet syndrome.
* The patient has evidence of chronic postural issues, with protraction of the scapulae.
* The patient has bilateral wrist pain that is clearly related proximal median nerve entrapment, for which nerve decompression surgery would be indicated.
* The patient is certainly at risk for radial tunnel syndrome, which may not be an issue at the moment because of her relatively low physical activity.
* The patient has painful mechanicalinstability her right wrist, pisiform, CMC joint and EPL tendon as well as the DRUJ.
* I suspect the patient has the same problems on the left side but she is in a Muenster cast, in the middle of treatment.

**Medical Decision Making**
A lengthy discussion ensued with the patient and her husband with regard to these issues. The role of upper extremity surgery and other status patience discussed at length and the patient and her husband are educated using anatomic models and visual displays.

On the left side, it is likely in my opinion that the nonoperative treatment will fail, given her overall collagen laxity. If so, treatment would be DRUJ ligament reconstruction. This could be performed with a Herbert sling procedure or an Adams extra-articular ligament reconstruction. Given the general poor quality of her tissues and her need for vigorous activity and caring for her son the ligament reconstruction using a free tendon graft would probably be optimal. This would require a Muenster splint/cast for at least 6 weeks after surgery, with initiation of vigorous activities around 2 months postop.

The other issues that the patient likely has could be addressed at the same time, at least that would be a possibility. This would include ligament reconstruction for the thumb CMC joint, capsular stabilization of the radiocarpal joint, carpectomy the pisiform and release of the proximal median nerve at least consideration of the release of the radial tunnel. These factors are discussed at length with the patient and her husband. The patient's husband attempted to write this information down but I am fairly certain I overwhelmed him between the anatomic complexity and the vocabulary. They are given homework with regard to education about these issues using online resources.

Radiographs of the cervical spine including flexion-extension views are indicated. The patient apparently had flexion-extension MRI images obtained sometime in the distant past and have asked her husband to track those down.

Follow-up after the removal of the cast from the left wrist, to review the radiographs and her clinical situation.

Face-to-face contact time was 86 minutes with additional 15 minutes dictating the summary.
